    <h1> Christopher D. Foehser Jr.</h1>
    <p> The purpose of this project was to create my first HTML for my class assignment.
        With what I learned so far in my course and what I am applying to this
        I will learn a beginner level of html. I started this class in October of 2022 
        with expectations for myself to finish this course and class by january of 2023.
        My plans after I finish my online classes for a full stack developer is to find an
        entry level position or internship to begin my full on journey into web developing and 
        gain real world experience.
